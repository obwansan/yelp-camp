// SHOW (restful route) - Shows more info about one campground.
// (NOTE: This kind of 'show' route must come after all other routes. Otherwise any other 
// route with a query string parameter after /campgrounds/ will be read as '/campgrounds/:id'.
// Anything after 'campgrounds/' will be read as ':id'.
// The campground object in the DB already has an ID (automatically assigned by mongoose when 
// the object (i.e. document) was created). 
// The 'SHow more' button link href in index.ejs appends this ID to /campgrounds/, so when you click it the SHOW route is hit ('/campgrounds/:id').
// The href link performs a GET request (http://localhost:3000/campgrounds/5cd8077b100dd70cf3ce08af).
// Therefore the ID can be pulled off the params object on the request object (req.params.id). Because the ID is a parameter in the query string (http://localhost:3000/campgrounds/5cd8077b100dd70cf3ce08af).

app.get('/campgrounds/:id', function(req, res) {
  // Find the campground with provided ID
  Campground.findById(req.params.id, function(err, foundCampground) {
    if(err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
        // Render show template with that campground 
        res.render('show', {campground:foundCampground});
    }
  })
});

passport.js and req.user

(1) req.user is created by passport whenever a user logs in. Well, req already exists each time a request is made from the client (front-end) to the server (back-end) then passport "hijacks" the req object and adds the user object to it (either undefined (user not logged in), or pointing to the logged in user)
req.body.user on the other hand would be representative of data coming from a form during a POST request where the form has inputs with name values such as name="user[username]"

(2) res.locals comes from express, see more here

(3) yes, it will get run every time a request is made, same for other app.use() instances that you mentioned. And yes, they are all middleware, much of what you see in express will be acting as middleware
