// SHOW (restful route) - Shows more info about one campground.
// (NOTE: This kind of 'show' route must come after all other routes. Otherwise any other 
// route with a query string parameter after /campgrounds/ will be read as '/campgrounds/:id'.
// Anything after 'campgrounds/' will be read as ':id'.
// The campground object in the DB already has an ID (automatically assigned by mongoose when 
// the object (i.e. document) was created). 
// The 'SHow more' button link href in index.ejs appends this ID to /campgrounds/, so when you click it the SHOW route is hit ('/campgrounds/:id').
// The href link performs a GET request (http://localhost:3000/campgrounds/5cd8077b100dd70cf3ce08af).
// Therefore the ID can be pulled off the params object on the request object (req.params.id). Because the ID is a parameter in the query string (http://localhost:3000/campgrounds/5cd8077b100dd70cf3ce08af).

app.get('/campgrounds/:id', function(req, res) {
  // Find the campground with provided ID
  Campground.findById(req.params.id, function(err, foundCampground) {
    if(err) {
      console.log(err);
    } else {
        // Render show template with that campground 
        res.render('show', {campground:foundCampground});
    }
  })
});
